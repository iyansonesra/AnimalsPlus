They love sunny spots with flowers to sip nectar from, like gardens, meadows, and even your own backyard!", cardFun: "\u{2022} Taste with their feet: No tongues here! Butterflies sip and taste nectar with tiny sensors on their legs. \n\n \u{2022} Wings are an illusion: Those vibrant wings aren't colored, but covered in thousands of tiny scales reflecting light like a prism! \n\n \u{2022} Migratory marvels: Some species, like the Monarch, embark on epic journeys, flying thousands of miles - like going from New York to California!

These striped hunters roam across Asia, from Russia's icy lands to Indonesia's tropical islands, as long as there's food and good hiding spots for catching prey.", cardFun: "\u{2022} Silent Stalkers: Tigers roar, but they're mostly quiet hunters, using stripes as camouflage and creeping close before pouncing. They're like ninjas of the jungle! \n \u{2022} Swimming Tigers: Don't underestimate their water skills! Tigers love a cool dip and can even swim long distances. \n \u{2022} Taste the Rainbow: Although they can't see in color, tigers have over 2,000 taste buds, making their meals extra delicious."),
